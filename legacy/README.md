# Legacy (WinForms / Visual Studio)

This folder contains the original **Windows-only WinForms/.NET** GUI (VTFEdit) and its Visual Studio solutions.

Status: **frozen / maintenance-only**.

- New development happens in the **Qt** GUI (QTFEdit) in the main project tree.
- The WinForms code is kept for reference and for users who still need it on Windows.
